## Getting Started

Firstly, ensure node.js is installed on your machine. If not please visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download) 
and download the LTS version. (This project was built with node v18.17.0)

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
````

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

However, this is likely not going to be very fast, especially for the dashboard page as all the rendering that would usually be done on the server-side is done on your machine. To get a better experience, you can visit the pre-rendered version of the side at [ist.willbarouch.com](https://ist.willbarouch.com).
